## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all store tests
npm test tests/state/stores

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage -- tests/state/stores

# Run specific store
npm test tests/state/stores/appStore.test.ts

# Watch mode
npm test -- --watch tests/state/stores
```

## Next Steps

### Recommended Enhancements
1. Add integration tests for inter-store communication
2. Add performance benchmarks
3. Add E2E tests for critical user flows
4. Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
5. Add visual regression tests for UI components

### Maintenance
- Keep tests updated with store changes
- Monitor coverage reports
- Add tests for new features
- Refactor duplicate test patterns
- Update documentation regularly
