`next lint` is deprecated and will be removed in Next.js 16.

For existing projects, migrate to the ESLint CLI:
npx @next/codemod@canary next-lint-to-eslint-cli .

 We detected multiple lockfiles and selected the directory of C:\Users\brand\Development\Project_Workspace\package-lock.json as the root directory.
 To silence this warning, set `outputFileTracingRoot` in your Next.js config, or consider removing one of the lockfiles if it's not needed.
