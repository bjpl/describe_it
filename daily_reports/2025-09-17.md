## Technical Decisions Made

### 1. Hide vs Delete Broken Accounts
```
Decision: Hide (remove URLs) instead of delete
Rationale:
  ✓ Preserve data
  ✓ May fix URLs later
  ✓ Easy to restore
  ✓ No data loss

Implementation:
  youtube_url: ""  # Empty string
  Filter: {% if url and url != "" %}
```

### 2. Claude Flow Swarm for Data Entry
```
Decision: Use swarm coordination for account research
Rationale:
  ✓ Faster than manual
  ✓ More comprehensive
  ✓ Better categorization
  ✓ Quality verification

Process:
  1. Research companies
  2. Find social media
  3. Verify authenticity
  4. Categorize appropriately
  5. Format data entries
```

### 3. New Category Creation
```
Decision: Add Telecommunications and Utilities
Rationale:
  ✓ Major business sectors
  ✓ 15+ accounts each
  ✓ Clear boundaries
  ✓ User value

Criteria Met:
  • Minimum 10 accounts ✅
  • Distinct category ✅
  • User interest ✅
  • Scalable ✅
```

### 4. Single Image Fallback
```
Decision: Use single image for Describe It instead of gallery
Rationale:
  ✓ Don't have multiple screenshots yet
  ✓ Better than broken images
  ✓ Clean presentation
  ✓ Can add gallery later

Implementation:
  image: "/path/to/main.png"
  # gallery: [] # Commented out
```
