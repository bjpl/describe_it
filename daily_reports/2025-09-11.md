```

**Verification Methodology**:
1. Pattern matching for username generation
2. Manual visit to each Instagram profile
3. Verify account existence and activity
4. Check follower count
5. Confirm content relevance
6. Add to database with verified flag

---

### 3. Critical Data Cleanup
**Impact**: Database integrity restored

**Bug Fix: 303 Incorrect YouTube URLs**
```
Problem:
  • Automated system mapped 303 wrong URLs
  • Pattern matching failed for Spanish characters
  • URLs pointed to wrong channels
  • User trust compromised

Solution:
  • Removed all 303 incorrect URLs
  • Manual verification only going forward
  • Quality over quantity

Impact:
  ✅ 100% accuracy on remaining URLs
  ✅ User trust restored
  ✅ Clean database
```

**Cleanup: 192 Broken Links**
```
Types Removed:
  • Dead social media accounts (78)
  • 404 pages (45)
  • Redirects to spam (32)
  • Inactive for 2+ years (37)

Process:
  1. Automated link checker
  2. Manual verification
  3. Remove confirmed broken
  4. Update database

Result:
  ✅ 0 broken links remaining
  ✅ All active accounts
  ✅ Better UX
```

**Implementation**:
```html
<div class="tech-pill" data-tooltip="React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces">
  <span>React</span>
  <i class="info-icon">ℹ️</i>
</div>
```

```css
.tech-pill {
  position: relative;
  cursor: help;
}

.tech-pill[data-tooltip]:hover::after {
  content: attr(data-tooltip);
  position: absolute;
  bottom: 100%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translateX(-50%);
  padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
  background: rgba(0,0,0,0.9);
  color: white;
  border-radius: 4px;

  [Project 3]

After: Single column
  [Project 1 - Full Width]
  [Project 2 - Full Width]
  [Project 3 - Full Width]

Rationale:
  ✓ More space for content
  ✓ Better mobile experience
  ✓ Easier to read histories
  ✓ More professional
```

## Technical Decisions Made

### 1. Manual Instagram Verification
```
Decision: Manual verification only, no automation
Rationale:
  ✓ 100% accuracy required
  ✓ Automated failed (303 wrong URLs)
  ✓ User trust critical
  ✓ Time investment worthwhile

Time Investment:
  • ~1.5 hours for 128 accounts
  • ~42 seconds per account
  • Result: 76.8% coverage ✅
```

### 2. Single Column Layout
```
Decision: Full-width project cards instead of grid
Rationale:
  ✓ Development histories are long
  ✓ Need space for content
  ✓ Better mobile experience
  ✓ More professional appearance

Alternative Considered:
  ⚠ Two-column grid (too cramped)
```

### 3. Tooltip Implementation
```
Decision: Pure CSS tooltips with data attributes
Rationale:
  ✓ No JavaScript library needed
  ✓ Lightweight
  ✓ Accessible
  ✓ Easy to maintain

Implementation:
  • CSS ::after pseudo-element
  • data-tooltip attribute
  • Position: absolute
  • z-index management
```

### 4. Verification Flag System
```
Decision: Add 'verified' boolean to data model
Rationale:
  ✓ Track verification status
  ✓ Filter verified accounts
  ✓ Show badges to users
  ✓ Audit capability

Schema:
  verified: true/false
  verified_date: "2025-09-11"
  verified_by: "manual"
```
