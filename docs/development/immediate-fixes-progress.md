# Project Progress Tracking - All Phases

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-02 (Project Start)
**Master Coordinator**: Active
**Total Duration**: 8 hours (across 3 phases)

---

## Executive Summary

This document tracks progress across all three project phases:
- **Phase 1 (Immediate)**: TypeScript fixes, typecheck, build verification
- **Phase 2 (Week 2)**: Logging migration, CI/CD setup, staging deployment
- **Phase 3 (Week 3-4)**: API unit testing

**Overall Progress**: 0/7 tasks completed (0%)

---

## Phase 1: Immediate Fixes (Hours 0-3)

### Agents Deployed
1. **TypeScript Compiler Agent** - Fix compilation errors
2. **Type Check Agent** - Resolve type errors
3. **Build Verification Agent** - Ensure production build succeeds

### Task Status

| Task | Agent | Status | Estimated | Actual | Target |
|------|-------|--------|-----------|--------|--------|
| Fix TypeScript compiler errors | TypeScript Compiler | Not Started | 2h | - | 0 errors |
| Fix type check errors | Type Check | Not Started | 2h | - | 0 errors |
| Verify production build | Build Verification | Not Started | 1h | - | Build success |

### Blockers
- None identified yet

### Dependencies
- All Phase 1 tasks must complete before Phase 2 begins
- TypeScript fixes should complete before type check

### Next Actions
1. Deploy Phase 1 agents
2. Monitor progress every 30 minutes
3. Track error counts and resolution

---

## Phase 2: Week 2 Implementation (Hours 3-6)

### Agents Deployed
1. **Logging Migration Agent** - Centralized logging system
2. **CI/CD Setup Agent** - GitHub Actions configuration
3. **Staging Deployment Agent** - Deploy to staging environment

### Task Status

| Task | Agent | Status | Estimated | Actual | Target |
|------|-------|--------|-----------|--------|--------|
| Migrate to centralized logging | Logging Migration | Awaiting Phase 1 | 2h | - | All logs centralized |
| Set up CI/CD pipeline | CI/CD Setup | Awaiting Phase 1 | 2h | - | Pipeline active |
| Deploy to staging | Staging Deployment | Awaiting Phase 1 | 1h | - | Successful deployment |

### Blockers
- **BLOCKED**: Awaiting Phase 1 completion
- Phase 2 cannot start until build succeeds

### Dependencies
- Phase 1 must complete successfully
- CI/CD requires passing build
- Staging deployment requires CI/CD pipeline

### Next Actions
1. Monitor Phase 1 progress
2. Prepare Phase 2 agents
3. Validate Phase 1 → Phase 2 handoff criteria

---

## Phase 3: Week 3-4 Testing (Hours 6-8)

### Agents Deployed
1. **API Testing Agent** - Comprehensive API unit tests

### Task Status

| Task | Agent | Status | Estimated | Actual | Target |
|------|-------|--------|-----------|--------|--------|
| Create API unit tests | API Testing | Awaiting Phase 2 | 2h | - | 80% coverage |

### Blockers
- **BLOCKED**: Awaiting Phase 2 completion
- Requires stable staging environment

### Dependencies
- Phase 2 staging deployment must succeed
- Logging system must be operational
- CI/CD must be running tests

### Next Actions
1. Monitor Phase 2 progress
2. Prepare testing strategy
3. Validate Phase 2 → Phase 3 handoff criteria

---

## Cross-Phase Metrics

### Time Tracking
- **Total Estimated**: 12 hours
- **Total Actual**: 0 hours
- **Efficiency**: TBD
- **Variance**: TBD

### Success Metrics
- **Phase 1 Target**: 0 TypeScript errors, successful build
- **Phase 2 Target**: Active CI/CD, successful staging deployment
- **Phase 3 Target**: 80% API test coverage
- **Overall Target**: Full production readiness

### Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Phase dependencies create sequential bottlenecks
- **Medium Risk**: TypeScript errors may be more complex than estimated
- **Low Risk**: Well-defined tasks with clear success criteria

---

## Monitoring Schedule

- **Every 30 minutes**: Check agent progress, update task status
- **Every 2 hours**: Generate progress report, update stakeholders
- **Phase transitions**: Validate handoff criteria, deploy next phase agents
- **Project completion**: Generate comprehensive reports

---

## Phase Handoff Criteria

### Phase 1 → Phase 2
- [ ] Zero TypeScript compiler errors
- [ ] Zero type check errors
- [ ] Production build succeeds
- [ ] All Phase 1 agents report completion

### Phase 2 → Phase 3
- [ ] Centralized logging operational
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline active and passing
- [ ] Staging environment deployed
- [ ] All Phase 2 agents report completion

### Phase 3 → Project Complete
- [ ] API tests created
- [ ] 80% test coverage achieved
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Final reports generated
