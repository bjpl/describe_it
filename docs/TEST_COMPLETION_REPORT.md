## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test suite
npm test tests/database/database-service.test.ts

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run integration tests only
npm test tests/integration
```

## Next Steps (Recommendations)

1. **Component Tests**: Add React component tests with database mocking
2. **E2E Tests**: Implement Playwright tests for critical user journeys
3. **Performance Tests**: Add load testing for concurrent users
4. **Visual Regression**: Add screenshot testing for UI components
5. **Accessibility Tests**: Add a11y testing with jest-axe
