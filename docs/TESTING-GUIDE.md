# User Testing Guide - Describe It

## Quick Start Testing

### 1. Run the App Locally

```bash
# Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your API keys:
# - OPENAI_API_KEY
# - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
# - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
# - UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY

# Start development server
npm run dev

# App will be available at: http://localhost:3000
```

### 2. Test on Staging/Production

**Option A: Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)**
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy to preview
vercel

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

**Option B: Docker (Local Production Build)**
```bash
# Build and run production version
docker-compose up --build

# App available at: http://localhost:3000
```

## Tips for Effective Self-Testing

1. **Test user flows end-to-end**: Start from signup → upload image → generate descriptions → complete Q&A → review progress

2. **Try edge cases**:
   - Very long Spanish descriptions
   - Images with no clear subject
   - Rapid clicking/interaction
   - Slow network simulation

3. **Take notes**: Keep a simple list of bugs or UX issues you find

4. **Test with real use case**: Use images you'd actually use for learning Spanish

5. **Clear data between tests**: Use incognito mode or clear browser data to test fresh user experience

## Quick Bug Report Template

When you find issues, note:
- **What happened**: [describe the bug]
- **Expected**: [what should happen]
- **Steps to reproduce**: [list steps]
- **Browser/Device**: [e.g., Chrome on MacOS]
