```

**Impact:** All unit tests unable to execute

#### 3. E2E Tests (tests/e2e/)
**Status:** Not executed due to time constraints

## Critical Failure Analysis

### 1. Authentication Failures (56 occurrences)
**Pattern:** `expected 401 to be 200`

**Affected Tests:**
- `/api/descriptions/generate` - All style variations
- `/api/qa/generate` - All Q&A generation tests
- `/api/translate` - Translation endpoints
- `/api/auth/*` - Authentication flows

**Root Cause:** Missing or invalid API authentication headers
- Anthropic API key not being passed correctly
- Environment variables not loaded in test environment
- Test fixtures missing authentication setup

**Recommended Fix:**
```typescript
// tests/integration/setup.ts
process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = 'sk-test-key-for-testing';
process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY = 'sk-test-key-for-testing';
```

### 2. Module Dependency Issues (1 occurrence)
**Pattern:** `Cannot find package 'debug/index.js'`

**Root Cause:** Package installation issue in WSL environment
- Permission conflicts during npm install
- Incomplete package installation

**Recommended Fix:**
```bash
# Clean install
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### 3. Service Integration Issues (1 failure)
**Test:** `should notify services when keys change through settings`

**Pattern:** Unexpected "anthropic" key in notification

**Root Cause:** KeyProvider now includes anthropic key but test expects only openai/unsplash

**Recommended Fix:**
```typescript
// Update test expectation to include anthropic key
expect(listener).toHaveBeenCalledWith({
  anthropic: expect.any(String),
  openai: "sk-new1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef123456",
  unsplash: "new1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef123456"
});
```

### 4. Timeout Issues (3 occurrences)
**Pattern:** Test suite execution timeout

**Affected:**
- Integration test suite (3 minute timeout)
- Unit test suite (2 minute timeout)

**Root Cause:**
- Slow API responses
- Concurrent test execution overhead
- WSL file system performance

**Recommended Fix:**
```typescript
// vitest.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    testTimeout: 30000, // 30s per test
    hookTimeout: 30000
  }
});
```

## Detailed Test Failures

### High Priority Fixes

#### 1. Claude API Tests (32/39 failed - 82% failure rate)

✗ should validate style parameter
✗ should enforce max length limits
✗ should include token usage metadata
✗ should handle concurrent requests efficiently
✗ should handle GET request for API info
```

**Common Issue:** All return 401 Unauthorized

#### 2. Auth Flow Tests (56/112 failed - 50% failure rate)
```
✗ User Registration Flow > should create new user successfully
✗ Login Flow > should authenticate valid credentials
✗ Session Management > should maintain user session
✗ Protected Routes > should require authentication
```

**Common Issue:** Authentication middleware not configured in test environment

```
✗ should save vocabulary items to database
✗ should retrieve user's vocabulary lists
✗ should update vocabulary item progress
✗ should handle duplicate vocabulary items
```

**Common Issue:** Database not initialized or authentication failures
**Impact:** Core learning features not validated

### Medium Priority Fixes

#### 4. Progress Flow Tests (16/51 failed - 31.4% failure rate)
```
✗ should track user learning progress
✗ should calculate progress metrics
