## Test Quality Metrics

### Current Status
- **Test Files:** 0
- **Test Suites:** 0
- **Total Tests:** 0
- **Passing Tests:** 0
- **Failing Tests:** 0
- **Skipped Tests:** 0

### Coverage Goals
- **Statements:** 80%+

- **Functions:** 80%+
- **Lines:** 80%+

## Known Issues

1. No test infrastructure in place
2. No component tests written
3. No coverage baseline established
4. No CI/CD integration for tests

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Begin Phase 1 testing
   - Set up Jest coverage reporting
   - Integrate tests into CI/CD pipeline
   - Establish coverage baseline

2. **Short-term Goals:**
   - Achieve 50% component coverage (Week 1)
   - Achieve 80% component coverage (Week 2)
   - Complete all high-priority tests (Week 2)
   - Document testing patterns (Week 2)

3. **Long-term Goals:**
   - Maintain 80%+ coverage
   - Implement visual regression testing
   - Add performance testing
   - Automate test generation

## Testing Standards

### Required Tests per Component

1. **Rendering (3-5 tests)**
   - Initial render with default props
   - Render with custom props
   - Render loading state
   - Render error state
   - Conditional rendering

2. **Interactions (3-8 tests)**
   - User events (clicks, typing, etc.)
   - Form submissions
   - Navigation
   - State changes

3. **Edge Cases (2-4 tests)**
   - Error handling
   - Empty states
   - Boundary conditions
   - Accessibility

4. **Integration (2-3 tests)**
   - With providers
   - With mocked APIs
   - With routing

### Minimum Viable Test Suite
- At least 8 tests per component
- Minimum 70% code coverage
- All user interactions tested
- All error states tested
- Accessibility verified

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Create test utilities (Completed)
2. âœ… Create documentation (Completed)
3. ğŸ”´ Begin Phase 1 testing (Next)
4. ğŸ”´ Set up coverage reporting
5. ğŸ”´ Integrate with CI/CD
6. ğŸ”´ Complete high-priority components
