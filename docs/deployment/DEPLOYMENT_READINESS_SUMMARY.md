## Next Steps Required

### 1. Install Updated Dependencies
```bash
# Clean install to ensure consistency
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- No errors during installation
- package-lock.json updated with new versions
- All peer dependencies resolved

### 2. Run Build Verification
```bash
# Type checking
npm run typecheck
# Expected: 0 errors

# Linting
npm run lint
# Expected: <5 warnings (current baseline)

# Build
npm run build
# Expected: Successful build, no errors

# Test suite
npm run test:run
# Expected: All tests passing
```

### 3. Verify Functionality
After successful build, test locally:
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Manual Testing Checklist:**
- [ ] App starts without errors
- [ ] Image upload and description generation works
- [ ] No console errors in browser
- [ ] Sharp library functioning correctly for image processing

## Success Criteria

### Build Verification
- ✅ TypeScript: 0 errors
- ✅ ESLint: <5 warnings
- ✅ Build: Successful with no errors
- ✅ Tests: All passing
- ✅ Bundle size: Within acceptable range (compare to baseline)

### Production Deployment
- ✅ All critical user flows work
- ✅ Error rate <0.1% for 24 hours
- ✅ Response time <3s average
- ✅ No critical bugs reported
- ✅ Database health metrics normal

## Risk Assessment

### Phase 1 Updates: LOW RISK ✅

**sharp (0.33.1 → 0.34.4):**
- Minor version update
- Well-maintained package (47M+ weekly downloads)
- Security patches included
- No breaking changes documented
- Used for: Image processing in vocabulary features

**@vercel/blob (1.1.1 → 2.0.0):**
- Not actively used in current codebase
- Zero runtime impact
- Future-proofing only
- Can be reverted easily if needed

### Mitigation Strategy
- Backup files created
- Full test suite will verify functionality
- Build verification before deployment
- Rollback plan documented
- Can revert to .backup files if issues arise

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ Run `npm install` to update dependencies
2. ✅ Verify build with `npm run build`
3. ✅ Run test suite: `npm run test:run`
4. ✅ Test locally with `npm run dev`
5. ✅ Review production deployment checklist

### Before Production Deployment
1. Complete database migrations in Supabase
2. Verify all environment variables in Vercel
3. Create database backup/snapshot
4. Schedule deployment window
5. Notify stakeholders

### During Deployment
1. Monitor Vercel deployment logs
2. Check for build errors
3. Verify initial functionality
4. Monitor error rates

### After Deployment
1. Complete functional testing checklist
2. Monitor for 24 hours
3. Collect user feedback
4. Document any issues
5. Schedule post-mortem (if needed)

## Rollback Strategy

**If issues occur during npm install or build:**
```bash
# Restore original package files
cp package.json.backup package.json
cp package-lock.json.backup package-lock.json
npm install
```

**If issues occur after deployment:**
