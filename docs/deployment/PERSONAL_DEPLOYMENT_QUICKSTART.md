# üöÄ Personal Deployment Quickstart
## Get Describe It Running For YOUR Use (30 minutes)

**Goal:** You using your app for language learning TODAY, not "someday"

---

## Philosophy

You built this to learn Spanish. Let's get you learning.

**Complexity later. Utility now.**

---

## Path 1: Vercel Free Tier (Recommended - 30 min)

### Why This Path?
- ‚úÖ Free forever (for personal use)
- ‚úÖ Auto-deploys on git push
- ‚úÖ Works on your phone
- ‚úÖ Fast edge network
- ‚úÖ Zero server management

### Step-by-Step

**1. Get API Keys (15 min)**

```bash
# OpenAI (required - costs ~$0.10-1.00 per day of active use)
1. Go to: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Create key: "describe-it-personal"
3. Set spending limit: $5/month
4. Copy: sk-proj-xxxxx

# Unsplash (required - free 50 requests/hour)
1. Go to: https://unsplash.com/oauth/applications
2. Create app: "Describe It - Personal"
3. Copy Access Key

# Supabase (required - free tier is generous)
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. New project: "describe-it-personal"
3. Wait 2 min for setup
4. Copy:
   - Project URL
   - Anon key
   - Service role key
```

**2. One-Command Security Keys (1 min)**

Tell me: **"Generate all security keys"** and I'll create them.

Or run yourself:
```bash
# Three commands:
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(16).toString('hex'))"
```

**3. Deploy to Vercel (10 min)**

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Login (opens browser)
vercel login

# Deploy (follow prompts)
vercel

# When asked:
# - Link to existing project? N
# - Project name? describe-it-personal
# - Directory? ./
# - Build command? npm run build
# - Output directory? .next
# - Override settings? N

# After first deploy, add environment variables:
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
vercel env add SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
vercel env add OPENAI_API_KEY
vercel env add OPENAI_MODEL
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY
vercel env add API_SECRET_KEY
vercel env add JWT_SECRET
vercel env add SESSION_SECRET

# Paste values when prompted (from steps 1 & 2)

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

**4. Set Up Database (5 min)**

Tell me: **"Set up my Supabase database for production"**

Or manually:
```bash
# Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor
# Copy scripts/migrations/001_create_missing_tables.sql
# Paste and Run
# Verify 11 tables created
```

**5. TEST IT (2 min)**

```bash
# Open your deployment
# URL from: vercel --prod output

# Test:
1. Sign up with your email
2. Search for "sunset"
3. Generate description
4. Save a word

‚úÖ If this works: YOU'RE LIVE!
```

---

## Path 2: Localhost (Fastest - 10 min)

### Why This Path?
- ‚úÖ No deployment needed
- ‚úÖ Free everything
- ‚úÖ Fastest to test
- ‚ùå Only works on your computer
- ‚ùå No mobile access

### Step-by-Step

**1. Create `.env.local`**

Tell me: **"Create my local environment file with test values"**

Or copy `.env.example` ‚Üí `.env.local` and fill in:
- Supabase keys (from above)
- OpenAI key (from above)
- Unsplash key (from above)

**2. Run Database Migrations**

Tell me: **"Apply database migrations to my local Supabase"**

**3. Start the App**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open: http://localhost:3000

**4. Start Learning Spanish**

That's it. Use it.

---

## Path 3: Docker (Self-Hosted - 20 min)

### Why This Path?
- ‚úÖ Full control
- ‚úÖ Can run on home server
- ‚úÖ No vendor lock-in
- ‚ùå More complex
- ‚ùå You manage updates

### Step-by-Step

```bash
# 1. Build image
docker build -t describe-it .

# 2. Run with environment
docker run -p 3000:3000 \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY=xxx \
  -e NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=xxx \
  -e NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=xxx \
  -e SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=xxx \
  -e NEXT_PUBLIC_UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=xxx \
  describe-it

# 3. Open browser
open http://localhost:3000
```

## What You Actually Need (Minimum Viable)

For personal use, you can skip:

‚ùå **Skip These:**
- Redis caching (use default memory cache)
- Sentry error tracking (console.log is fine)
- Analytics (you know when you use it)
- Performance monitoring (does it feel fast?)
- Rate limiting (you won't abuse yourself)

‚úÖ **Keep These:**
- Supabase (your data)
- OpenAI (AI descriptions)
- Unsplash (images)
- Authentication (secure your data)

---

## Personal Use Configuration

### Recommended Settings

```env
# .env.local for PERSONAL use

# Required
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-xxx
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini          # Cheapest, good quality
OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS=500             # Shorter = cheaper
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=xxx
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=xxx
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=xxx
NEXT_PUBLIC_UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=xxx

# Personal optimizations
LOG_LEVEL=error                    # Less noise
ENABLE_REDIS_CACHE=false          # Not needed for 1 user
ENABLE_ANALYTICS=false            # Just you
ENABLE_PERFORMANCE_MONITORING=false
DEBUG_ENDPOINT_ENABLED=true       # Useful for you
ENABLE_DEMO_MODE=false

# Cost controls (important!)
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=1000      # Very generous for 1 user
OPENAI_TEMPERATURE=0.7            # Good balance
```

### Cost Expectations (Personal Use)

```
Daily active use (30 min of learning):
- OpenAI: ~10-20 descriptions = $0.10-0.30
- Unsplash: Free (50/hour limit)
- Supabase: Free tier (500MB, plenty)
- Vercel: Free tier

Monthly (using daily):
- OpenAI: ~$3-10 depending on usage
- Everything else: $0
‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
TOTAL: $3-10/month

Weekend warrior (2-3x per week):
TOTAL: $1-3/month

Occasional use:
TOTAL: Under $1/month
```

**Cost Control:**
```bash
# Set OpenAI spending limit
1. https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing
2. Usage limits ‚Üí Set to $10/month
3. Enable email alerts at $5
```

---

## Mobile Access

### Option 1: PWA (Works with Vercel deployment)

After deploying:
```
1. Open your-app.vercel.app on phone
2. Safari: Share ‚Üí Add to Home Screen
3. Chrome: Menu ‚Üí Install App

‚úÖ Now it's an app icon on your phone
‚úÖ Works offline (cached content)
‚úÖ Feels like native app
```

### Option 2: Expo/React Native (Later)

Your codebase is ready for this, but skip for now.
Use PWA first, see if you need native.

## Next Steps After Personal Use

### Week 1: Just Use It
- Don't think about improvements
- Don't add features
- Just learn Spanish with it
- Take notes of friction

### Week 2-4: Refine Based on YOUR Experience
- Fix the 3 most annoying things
- Improve the core learning flow
- Optimize for your actual usage patterns

### Month 2: Decision Point

**If you're using it daily:**
```
Option A: Keep it personal (perfectly valid!)
- Optimize for your needs
- Add features you want
- No pressure
- Just enjoy your tool

Option B: Consider sharing
- Add 5 beta testers
- Get their feedback
- See if value is universal
- Then decide on monetization
```

**If you're NOT using it daily:**
```
Ask why:
- Wrong problem?
- Wrong solution?
- Wrong approach?
- Right idea, wrong execution?

Pivot or stop before investing more.
```

---

## Monetization Planning (Future - Only If You Use It)

### Validation Milestones

**Milestone 1: You use it daily for 30 days**
‚Üí Product has personal value
‚Üí Worth considering for others

**Milestone 2: 5 friends use it weekly**
‚Üí Value might be universal
‚Üí Worth refining UX

**Milestone 3: People ask "can I pay for this?"**
‚Üí Market signal
‚Üí Time to monetize

### Pricing Models (If You Get There)

**Free Tier (Loss Leader):**
```
- 10 descriptions per day
- Basic flashcards
- Single language pair
- Mobile web access

Goal: Get users hooked
Cost: ~$0.50-1/user/month (OpenAI)
```

**Pro Tier ($5-10/month):**
```
- Unlimited descriptions
- Advanced flashcards
- Multiple language pairs
- Offline mode
- Priority support
- Export features

Goal: Convert 5-10% of free users
Revenue: Covers costs + profit
```

**Lifetime ($49-99):**
```
- All Pro features
- Lifetime access
- Support development
- Early access to features

Goal: Validate demand
Revenue: Fund development
```

But this is **month 2+ decision**, not today.

```

### This Week:
- Use it daily
- Take notes
- Fix blockers
- Enjoy learning

### Next Month:
- Still using it? Great, optimize
- Not using it? Pivot or stop
- Others want it? Consider sharing

### Someday:
- Proven value? Monetize
- No traction? Keep personal
- Lost interest? That's fine too

## Need Help?

**For deployment issues:**
```bash
# Tell me:
"I'm stuck on deployment step X"
"This error appeared: [paste error]"
"How do I configure Y?"
```

**For usage optimization:**
```bash
# Tell me:
"The learning flow feels slow"
"I want to add feature X for my use"
"Can we simplify Y?"
```

**For monetization (later):**
```bash
# Tell me:
"I've used it daily for a month, what's next?"
"5 people want access, how do I manage this?"
"Ready to explore paid tiers, what do I need?"
```

---

## Bottom Line

**You have two goals:**
1. Learn Spanish (primary)
2. Maybe make money (bonus)

**Let's nail #1 first.**

If the app helps you learn Spanish effectively, #2 becomes easy.

If it doesn't help you learn, #2 doesn't matter.

**Ship it. Use it. Learn from it.**

Everything else is details.
