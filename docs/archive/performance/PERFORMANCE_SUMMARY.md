## 🛠️ Technical Implementations

### 1. Advanced Webpack Configuration
```javascript
// Key optimizations added:
- Vendor chunk separation (React, React-DOM)
- UI library chunking (@radix-ui, lucide-react, framer-motion)
- Utility chunking (axios, zod, zustand)
- Tree shaking with modularized imports
- Bundle analysis integration
```

### 2. Performance Middleware Stack
```javascript
// API performance enhancements:
export const GET = withPerformanceMonitoring(
  withRequestDeduplication(
    withAdvancedRateLimit(
      { requests: 60, window: 60, burst: 10 },
      getHandler
    )
  )
)
```

### 3. Image Optimization Strategy
```javascript
// Optimized image loading:
- Next.js Image component with automatic optimization
- Lazy loading for non-critical images
- WebP/AVIF format support
- Blur placeholders with smooth transitions
- Responsive sizing for different viewports
```

### 4. Real-time Performance Monitoring
```javascript
// Live performance tracking:
- Web Vitals monitoring (FCP, LCP, FID, CLS)
- Bundle size tracking
- API performance metrics
- Memory usage monitoring
- Network request analytics
```
