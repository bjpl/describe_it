   });
   ```

2. **Implement React.memo with Custom Comparison**
   ```typescript
   export const OptimizedComponent = memo(ComponentBase, (prevProps, nextProps) => {
     return shallowCompare(prevProps, nextProps);
   });
   ```

3. **Memoize Callbacks and Expensive Calculations**
   ```typescript
   const stableCallback = useCallback(() => {}, [dependencies]);
   const expensiveValue = useMemo(() => heavyCalculation(), [data]);
   ```

4. **Optimize Animations**
   ```typescript
   const variants = useMemo(() => optimizeAnimations.createOptimizedVariants({
     // animation config
   }), []);
   ```
