# üéØ Strategic Testing Recommendations

## Priority Action Items for Development Team

### üö® CRITICAL (Week 1)

1. **Fix Unit Test Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Update vitest.config.ts to resolve ES module issues
   npm run test  # Should work without ERR_REQUIRE_ESM
   ```

2. **Implement Basic Security Testing**
   ```typescript
   // Add to test pipeline:
   - npm audit --audit-level high
   - OWASP ZAP baseline scan
   - Input validation testing
   ```

3. **Establish CI/CD Pipeline**
   ```yaml
   # .github/workflows/ci.yml
   name: CI/CD Pipeline
   on: [push, pull_request]
   jobs:
     test:
       - Unit tests (target: 40% coverage)
       - Integration tests (maintain 90%)
       - E2E tests (maintain 95%)
       - Security scanning
   ```

### ‚ö° HIGH PRIORITY (Month 1)

1. **Unit Test Development Strategy**
   - Focus on critical components first: SearchSection, DescriptionPanel, QAPanel
   - Target 80% statement coverage
   - Use Testing Library for React component testing

2. **Performance Testing Enhancement**
   - Add Core Web Vitals monitoring
   - Implement Lighthouse CI
   - Set performance budgets

3. **Code Quality Improvements**
   - Fix 400+ ESLint warnings
   - Reduce TypeScript `any` usage by 80%
   - Implement pre-commit hooks

### üìà MEDIUM PRIORITY (Quarter 1)

1. **Advanced Testing Features**
   - Visual regression testing
   - Contract testing for APIs
   - Chaos engineering experiments

2. **Test Automation**
   - Automated test result reporting
   - Performance regression alerts
   - Coverage trend monitoring
