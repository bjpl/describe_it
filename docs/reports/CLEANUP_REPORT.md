# Cleanup Report Template

**Date:** [Generated on execution]
**Project:** Describe It
**Purpose:** Remove unnecessary backup files from repository

---

## Executive Summary

This report documents the cleanup operation to remove backup files (*.backup, *.fixed, *.old, *.bak, *.tmp) from the repository. The cleanup process includes:

1. **Final Backup Creation** - Archive of all backup files before deletion
2. **File Deletion** - Removal of backup files from working directory
3. **Verification** - Confirmation that primary files exist and backups are removed
4. **Documentation** - Comprehensive logging of all operations

---

## Backup Files Identified

### Files Found Before Cleanup

The following backup files were identified in the repository:

| File Path | Type | Size | Last Modified |
|-----------|------|------|---------------|
| tests/components/PhrasesPanel.test.tsx.backup | .backup | - | - |
| src/lib/monitoring/web-vitals.ts.backup | .backup | - | - |
| src/app/api/status/route.ts.backup | .backup | - | - |
| src/lib/auth/AuthManager.ts.fixed | .fixed | - | - |

**Total Backup Files:** 4

## Cleanup Process

### Step 1: Final Backup Creation

- **Backup Location:** `/docs/cleanup/final-backup-[timestamp]/`
- **Files Archived:** [Count]
- **Archive Status:** [Created/Failed]
- **Notes:** Final safety backup created before any deletions

### Step 2: File Deletion

| File | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| tests/components/PhrasesPanel.test.tsx.backup | [Deleted/Failed] | - |
| src/lib/monitoring/web-vitals.ts.backup | [Deleted/Failed] | - |
| src/app/api/status/route.ts.backup | [Deleted/Failed] | - |
| src/lib/auth/AuthManager.ts.fixed | [Deleted/Failed] | - |

**Deletion Summary:**
- **Successfully Deleted:** [Count]
- **Failed Deletions:** [Count]
- **Errors Encountered:** [List any errors]

### Step 3: Verification

#### Primary Files Verification

| Primary File | Exists | Status |
|--------------|--------|--------|
| src/lib/monitoring/web-vitals.ts | [Yes/No] | [OK/Missing] |
| src/lib/auth/AuthManager.ts | [Yes/No] | [OK/Missing] |
| tests/components/PhrasesPanel.test.tsx | [Yes/No] | [OK/Missing] |
| src/app/api/status/route.ts | [Yes/No] | [OK/Missing] |

#### Remaining Backup Files Check

- **Backup Files Found:** [Count]
- **Status:** [Clean/Issues Found]

## Gitignore Updates

The following patterns were added to `.gitignore` to prevent future backup file commits:

```gitignore
# Backup and temporary files (prevent accidental commits)
*.backup
*.fixed
*.old
*.bak
*.tmp
*~
*.swp
*.swo

# Editor temporary files
.*.swp
.*.swo
*~
.#*
\#*\#
```

**Rationale:**
- `*.backup` - TypeScript/code backup files
- `*.fixed` - Manual fix backup files
- `*.old` - Renamed old versions
- `*.bak` - Generic backup extension
- `*.tmp` - Temporary processing files
- `*~` - Vim/Emacs backup files
- `*.swp`, `*.swo` - Vim swap files

## Recommendations

1. **Git Commit:** Commit the `.gitignore` updates to prevent future backup commits
2. **Final Backup:** Keep the final backup archive for 30 days before deletion
3. **Verification:** Run `npm run typecheck` and `npm test` to ensure no breakage
4. **Documentation:** Update any references to removed files
5. **Monitoring:** Watch for any new backup file creation patterns

## Next Steps

- [ ] Review verification results
- [ ] Commit `.gitignore` updates
- [ ] Run full test suite
- [ ] Run TypeScript type checking
- [ ] Monitor for new backup file creation
- [ ] Archive or delete final backup after 30 days
