- **Memory Usage**: 100MB target
- **API Response Time**: 500ms target

## 🛠 Implementation Details

### React Performance Optimizations
```typescript
// Custom performance hooks
useExpensiveMemo() // Tracks expensive calculations
usePerformanceCallback() // Monitors callback execution time
useRenderOptimization() // Detects excessive re-renders
useOptimizedApiCall() // API calls with caching and retries
useVirtualScrolling() // For large lists
```

### Bundle Optimization Strategy
```javascript
// Advanced webpack chunking
- react: React framework (40 priority)
- next: Next.js framework (35 priority)
- animations: Framer Motion (30 priority)
- ui: Radix UI components (25 priority)
- data: TanStack Query (20 priority)
- vendors: Other node_modules (10 priority)
- app-ui: Application UI components (15 priority)
- performance: Performance monitoring (12 priority)
```

### Web Vitals Integration
```typescript
// Automatic Web Vitals reporting
getCLS(sendToAnalytics);
getFID(sendToAnalytics);
getFCP(sendToAnalytics);
getLCP(sendToAnalytics);
getTTFB(sendToAnalytics);
getINP(sendToAnalytics);
```

## 📈 Expected Performance Improvements

### Bundle Size Reduction
- **25-40% smaller initial bundles** through advanced chunking
- **Improved caching** with deterministic chunk IDs
- **Better tree shaking** eliminating unused code

### Runtime Performance
- **Reduced re-renders** with React.memo and optimized hooks
- **Faster image loading** with lazy loading and intersection observer
- **Improved memory management** with leak prevention hooks

### User Experience
- **Faster perceived load times** with progressive enhancement
- **Smoother interactions** with optimized event handlers
- **Better responsiveness** with virtual scrolling for large datasets

## 🔧 Development Tools

### Performance Dashboard
- **Real-time metrics** visible during development
- **Performance budget violations** highlighted immediately
- **Historical trend tracking** with export capabilities

### Audit Scripts
- **Comprehensive performance auditing** with Puppeteer
- **Automated recommendations** based on Web Vitals
- **Bundle analysis** with size breakdown
- **Screenshot capture** for visual regression testing

## 🚨 Performance Alerts

### Automatic Warnings
- **Slow components** (>10ms render time)
- **Excessive re-renders** (>10 renders)
- **Large API responses** (>2s response time)
- **Memory pressure** (>100MB heap usage)
- **Bundle size violations** (exceeding budgets)

### Monitoring Integration
```bash
# Run performance audit
npm run audit:performance

# Monitor Web Vitals in development
npm run dev # Includes real-time monitoring

# Generate performance report
node scripts/performance-audit.js
```

## 🎯 Performance Score Calculation

The performance score is calculated based on:
- **Web Vitals compliance** (60% weight)
- **Bundle size efficiency** (20% weight)
- **Memory usage** (10% weight)
- **API response times** (10% weight)

Target scores:
- **90-100**: Excellent performance
- **70-89**: Good performance
- **50-69**: Needs improvement
- **<50**: Poor performance requiring immediate attention

## 📝 Usage Instructions

### Enable Performance Monitoring
```tsx
// Layout includes monitoring in development
import { WebVitalsMonitor, PerformanceDashboard } from '@/components/Performance';

// Keyboard shortcuts
