## Verification Checklist

After completing the setup, verify:

- [ ] **Workflows are active**
  ```bash
  gh workflow list
  # Should show all 5 workflows
  ```

- [ ] **Secrets are configured**
  ```bash
  gh secret list
  # Should show VERCEL_TOKEN (and optional tokens)
  ```

- [ ] **Environments exist**
  ```bash
  # Check: Settings ‚Üí Environments
  # Should see: production, staging
  ```

- [ ] **Branch protection is active**
  ```bash
  # Check: Settings ‚Üí Branches
  # Should see: main branch protected
  ```

- [ ] **CI pipeline runs on push**
  ```bash
  # Make a commit to develop
  # Check: Actions tab shows workflow running
  ```

## Common Issues & Quick Fixes

### Issue 1: Workflow Not Triggering

**Symptom:** Push code but no workflow runs

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check workflow files are in correct location
ls .github/workflows/*.yml

# Verify workflows are enabled
# Settings ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí General ‚Üí Allow all actions
```

### Issue 2: Vercel Deployment Fails

**Symptom:** "Error: Invalid token"

**Fix:**
```bash
# Regenerate Vercel token
1. Vercel ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Tokens ‚Üí Create new
2. Update GitHub secret with new token
3. Re-run workflow
```

### Issue 3: Health Check Fails

**Symptom:** Deployment succeeds but health check fails

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check Vercel environment variables
vercel env ls

# Ensure required env vars are set:
- OPENAI_API_KEY
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
- SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
```

### Issue 4: Tests Fail in CI but Pass Locally

**Fix:**
```bash
# Run tests with CI environment
CI=true npm run test

# Check Node version matches CI
node --version  # Should be 20.x

# Clear caches
rm -rf .next node_modules/.cache
npm ci
npm test
```

## Daily Development Workflow

### For Feature Development

```bash
# 1. Create feature branch from develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/my-feature

# 2. Make changes and commit
# CI runs on every push
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add new feature"
git push origin feature/my-feature

# 3. Create PR to develop
gh pr create --base develop

# 4. Wait for CI to pass and get staging deployment

# 5. Request review

# 6. Merge after approval
# Staging auto-deploys
```

### For Production Release

```bash
# 1. Verify staging is stable
# Check staging URL and all tests pass

# 2. Create PR from develop to main
gh pr create --base main --head develop

# 3. Wait for all checks to pass

# 4. Get approval from required reviewers

# 5. Merge PR
# Production deployment triggers automatically

# 6. Monitor deployment
gh run watch

# 7. Verify production
# Check production URL
# Run smoke tests
```

---

## Emergency Procedures

### Emergency Hotfix

```bash
# 1. Create hotfix branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-fix

# 2. Make minimal fix and commit
git add .
git commit -m "fix: Critical production issue"
git push origin hotfix/critical-fix

# 3. Create PR to main
gh pr create --base main

# 4. If extremely urgent, use emergency deploy
gh workflow run cd-production.yml --field skip_tests=true
# ‚ö†Ô∏è Only use skip_tests in true emergencies!

# 5. After fix, merge hotfix to develop
git checkout develop
git merge hotfix/critical-fix
git push origin develop
```

### Rollback Production

```bash
# Option 1: Revert commit
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
# Production auto-deploys

# Option 2: Vercel rollback
vercel rollback <deployment-url>

# Option 3: Deploy previous commit
gh workflow run cd-production.yml --ref <previous-commit-sha>
```
