# ADR-001: Architecture Overview and Technology Stack

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2024-01-15

## Context

The Describe It application is a Spanish learning platform that combines visual learning with AI-powered language education. We needed to select a technology stack that would:

1. Support real-time AI content generation
2. Handle image processing and storage efficiently
3. Provide excellent user experience with fast loading times
4. Scale to accommodate growing user base
5. Maintain high security standards for user data
6. Support multiple languages and learning styles

## Decision

We decided to build the application using the following architecture:

### Frontend & Framework
- **Next.js 14 with App Router**: Modern React framework with server-side rendering, optimal for SEO and performance
- **TypeScript**: Type safety and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
- **Radix UI**: Accessible component primitives

### Backend & API
- **Next.js API Routes**: Serverless functions for backend logic
- **Node.js 20+**: Latest LTS version for optimal performance
- **OpenAI GPT-4**: AI content generation for descriptions and Q&A
- **Unsplash API**: High-quality image search functionality

### Database & Storage
- **Supabase**: PostgreSQL database with real-time capabilities and built-in authentication
- **Vercel KV (Redis)**: Fast caching and session management
- **Vercel Blob**: File storage for generated exports and user content

### State Management
- **Zustand**: Lightweight state management for client-side state
- **React Query (TanStack Query)**: Server state management, caching, and synchronization
- **React Context**: Component-level state sharing

### Development & Deployment
- **Vercel**: Hosting platform with edge functions and global CDN
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
- **Vitest**: Fast unit testing framework
- **Playwright**: End-to-end testing

## Consequences

### Positive
1. **Performance**: Next.js App Router provides excellent performance with SSR and static generation
2. **Developer Experience**: TypeScript + modern tooling improves development velocity and code quality
3. **Scalability**: Serverless architecture scales automatically with demand
4. **Real-time Features**: Supabase enables real-time collaboration and updates
5. **AI Integration**: OpenAI API provides powerful language generation capabilities
6. **Security**: Built-in security features from Supabase and Vercel
7. **Cost Efficiency**: Pay-per-use model keeps costs low during early stages

### Negative
1. **Vendor Lock-in**: Heavy reliance on Vercel and Supabase ecosystems
2. **Cold Start Latency**: Serverless functions may have initial delays
3. **API Rate Limits**: External APIs (OpenAI, Unsplash) have usage limitations
4. **Learning Curve**: Next.js App Router is relatively new with evolving patterns

### Risks & Mitigations
1. **API Availability**: Implemented fallback systems for demo mode when APIs are unavailable
2. **Data Migration**: Designed database schema to be portable across PostgreSQL providers
3. **Cost Management**: Implemented rate limiting and caching to control API usage
4. **Performance**: Added monitoring and optimization strategies

## Alternative Considered

### 1. Traditional LAMP Stack
- **Rejected**: Would require more server management and doesn't provide modern development experience

### 2. Separate Frontend/Backend (React + Express)
- **Rejected**: Increases complexity with API versioning and deployment coordination

### 3. Serverless-first with AWS
- **Rejected**: Higher complexity for small team, steeper learning curve

### 4. Full-stack frameworks (T3 Stack, Remix)
- **Considered**: T3 Stack was seriously considered but Next.js App Router provided better file-based routing

## Monitoring & Observability

- **Error Tracking**: Sentry integration for error monitoring
- **Performance**: Web Vitals monitoring and Vercel Analytics
- **Logging**: Structured logging with Winston
- **Health Checks**: Comprehensive health endpoints for all services

## Migration Strategy

If migration becomes necessary:
1. **Database**: PostgreSQL dump/restore to new provider
2. **Authentication**: Export user data via Supabase APIs
3. **File Storage**: Programmatic transfer of blob storage
4. **API Keys**: Update environment variables
5. **DNS**: Update routing to new infrastructure

## Review Schedule

This architecture decision will be reviewed:
- **Quarterly**: Performance metrics and cost analysis
- **Semi-annually**: Technology stack evaluation
- **As needed**: When facing scaling challenges or new requirements
